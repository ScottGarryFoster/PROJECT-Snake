# Summary
Video game by Bandai Namco using the arcade classic Pac-man licence. Develops using a infinite runner and rouge-like genre. Players move around levels in a single direction, avoid enemies (ghosts), pickup weapons and eat pellets for score. Between rounds they may level up their weapons.

Suggestion from the article in [[Article - 12 Best Endless Runner Mobile Games, Ranked]].

# Take-Aways
* Game appears to use both elements from Rouge Like games and Infinite runners - Infinite runners continually push players in a direction, rouge likes have generated levels with powerups boosted over time.

## Mechanics
Some information from the below is from this source: [Fruits and Ghosts by App Gamer](https://www.appgamer.com/pac-man256/strategy-guide/fruits-and-ghosts)
1. Move in four direction
2. Stop when you hit the walls of the Maze
3. Eat dots / pallets which increase score
4. Eat special items such as fruit which increases your score
5. Enemies are ghosts and have differing behaviours.
6. Pink ghosts will charge at the player until they hit the walls of the maze
	* Pink ghosts also appear to be slightly faster than the player
7. Lime green ghosts patrol from wall to wall
8. Grey ghosts remain dormant until the player is near
6. Red ghosts always chases Pac-man. They are the same speed as Pac-man and will take the shortest route.
7. Orange ghosts move vertically and has a set patrol pattern. This ghost does not give chase.
8. Blue ghosts patrol in circles around particular areas and are only a danger when in junction with other ghosts.
9. If a ghost is in full colour, those colours being any which are not navy blue and white, they are prone.
10. If a prone ghost collides with Pac-man, Pac-man dies and the game is over
11. Moving from the lower section of the screen towards where the level grows from is a glitchy void which increases in size as time goes on.
12. Touching the void or existing in the level section which is now void, leads to death and the game over state
13. There is also a glitch ghost. Glitch ghost begins as either non-violent (run into a collect) or random ghost behaviour (generally later on)
14. Upon death it is noted that you may unlock new special items the next time you play based on the score unlocked in the previous games.
15. Players may also unlock coins based on how well they played and if they achieved a challenge in the current play through
16. Coins also appear in feed gifts at the end of levels. It is unclear if this is from achievements.
17. Challenges vary and are displayed when beginning a new game, a challenge example is collect 5 cherries.
18. Coins are used to boost items, for instance their effectiveness time or score given
19. Coins may be collected during a level not just at the end
20. Items include laser, freeze or bombs.
21. Bigger pallets and coins offer more score reward
22. Occasionally on the level you may move from one side of the board to the other. This is done blindly however there is a short time of invincibility
23. Items must be selected in a loadout of three to spawn
24. Items are upgraded out side of the level. They begin at level zero and conclude at level 8.
25. Game offers multiplayer and single player modes. Multiplayer appears to be local (at least on PC)
26. The gifts are offered as a box which opens up the coins, this appears as though the coins are randomised.
27. Eating fruit offer different score multipliers. Cherry x2, Apple x3, Strawberry x4, Orange x5 and Green Melon x6.
28. Occasionally there are arrows Pac-man may move on, if Pac-man moves with the arrows their speed is increased, otherwise decreased

# Interface
1. Numbers appear as you eat pallets indicating the streak potentially
2. Items which increase score are shown under the score at the top of the screen
3. Every multiple of 16 the streak number is blue
	* Appears to be 16, 32, 64 and so on.
4. The last number of a streak (when no longer collecting a pallet) is an orange colour
5. When a powerup which is timed is collected there is a timer bar (bar which decreases right to left) is displayed at the top of the screen.
6. Numbers from food streaks fade out of existence
7. Gameover words fly in from both sides of the screen
8. Challenge is displayed as you start the level and for a few seconds into the level at the top
9. Coins are displayed at the top of the screen and + is shown upon collecting coins
10. When upgrading the value of every upgrade is shown - greyed out if the player may not afford the upgrade
11. When upgrading a bar moves left to right with the item increasing in size until showing the level
12. It is not clear before upgrading an item what the result will be. Afterwards there is a brief flash in the UI for this.
13. Highscore multiplier is shown to the player on screen when they achieve it

## Visuals
1. Maze walls change colour as the player progresses
2. Characters are made up of voxels emulating their pixelated routes
3. Fonts chosen are pixelated
4. Ghosts explode into pieces of the colour they were (navy blue) when eaten
5. Ghosts move off screen as just eyes
6. Background appears to be sky with ghosts and pallets moving towards glitch wall
7. Coins and other items dance and move to attract the players to them
8. When Pac-man dies the level ripples with a shockwave
9. All Pack-man pieces explode when Pac-man dies
10. When opening a coin box the box explodes into the coins

## Audio
1. Sound on level start, with a count down
2. Sound on every food pallet eaten and additional sounds for special items
3. Sound on streak reaching a multiple of 16 and the streak ending
4. As the glitch part of the level draws closer an ambient sound plays
5. Sound continually plays when Pac-man is prone
6. Sound plays when ghosts are eaten / destroyed in other means
7. Sound upon death
8. Basic interface sounds else where
9. Music in the main menus
10. Sound upon a high score achieved such as best chain or best general high score
11. Different sound upon a new high score in general at the end of a level / death almost like clinks of coins out of an arcade machine
12. Coin Loot crate sound builds up until opening each coin then makes a sound as it reaches the wallet
