# Take-Aways
* Closer to the version I (Scott Foster) played as a Child
* Playing with a screen wrap is more pleasing as splitting the screen is not as damning and leads to better techniques

## Mechanics
* Move in four directions
* Cannot got back on self (up then down)
* Death means movement onto self
* When moving off side of the screen, snake wraps around
* Start at a size of five
* Score increases by one each food you eat
* Larger food is found for a short period of time - these are worth 5 score

## Interface
* Retro phone buttons on a touch screen
* Audio on eating and Death
* Vibration occurs on eating
* Same sound for all food
* Score is found on the screen at all times
* High scores are kept, but are separate from the main game in another menu
* Options for sound and vibration are kept there also

## Visuals
* Snake eats (mouth opens) as they get near the food
* Body rotates around corners
* Snake has a head (you always know the head from the tail)
* Dot Matrix recreation making it easy to figure out which row/column you are on
