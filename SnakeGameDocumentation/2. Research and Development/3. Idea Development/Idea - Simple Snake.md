# Summary
A simple recreation of the classic game of snake. Recreated from the original version using a design similar to the original version of the game. This would allow for idea development and overall game development for future mechanics to be introduced on top of a base design.

# Feature
These points are all the features which must be implemented to create this idea.
1. Game is played on a pixel grid, emulating a dot matrix
2. Player may press any button to begin a game
3. Movement is in any of the four cardinal directions other than reversing
4. Movement begins in the direction the snake is facing.
5. Snake is rendered on the screen using the dot matrix
6. Border is rendered on the screen
7. Food is rendered on the screen.
8. Food is placed in a random location upon the screen which is not a tile the snake occupies
9. Snake begins as a five piece (size) snake
10. Upon moving the head into food, the tile the food is on becomes the new head location and the tail is no longer removed - the snake has increased in size by one
11. Upon the snake moving their head into a tile which they own the game is over
12. Upon moving off the board the tile on the opposite side is used as the tile to continue movement - looping occurs - provided this is not a tile the snake already exists.
13. Food is a single tile big along with each segment of the snake
14. Randomly a larger piece of food 2x1 may spawn for a short period of time which awards 5 score and one snake length upon eating (moving head into)
15. Eating means the food piece is no longer rendered and replaced (except for larger pieces which may spawn with smaller pieces but randomly).
16. Score is displayed on the screen and when death occurs
17. High scores are kept
18. Scores are one plus the number of food (of any type) are eaten
19. An audio clip is played upon eating
20. An audio clip is played upon dying.
21. If the Snakes head is facing the food (food is to the right of the snake and the snake is approaching from the right) the image changes to display the the snake opening their mouth
22. The camera is fixed on a single scene, you may see the entire board, where the food spawns and boarders.

# Development
These are ideas built on the initial idea to be developed further.

1. Have a camera follow the Snakes head with levels you must traverse.
2. Restrict the border loop and then introduce levels and pickups
3. Use the Border loops and levels to introduce puzzle based level design
4. Create a Snake Role Playing Game
5. Snake Multiplayer Racing or Battles?
