# Summary
Research and development encompasses the entire concept and idea development for the project. This is the home of ideas and the core origins of the ideas. There may be research performed in other areas with the heading research and development however this category is for pre-game, pre-design decisions. Additionally if there are major changes or major new elements these are also captured within this area.

You can think of each section referencing the previous section. References are the source of resources (unless directly searched). Ideas are found in the Resource summaries (unless wrought from the mind of the creator). Prototypes are foundationally from Idea development.

# References and Sources
This contains the origins for the resources of ideas or concepts. Think of this section as resources for resources. If there is a list of games to try out, this does not make great primary research for a resource summary but playing the games does - resource for a resource. If there is a book recommendation, new release list or sales chart - all of these are reasons to review and add to the resource summary section.

# Resource Summaries
Gathering research requires a lot of material and referencing. Reading all the references on every occasion it is required is not an efficient method of research therefore this section will contain summaries of resources. The summaries are the main notes from a resource which may then be incorporated into the overall development.

# Idea Development
Taking the research as a base, ideas are developed into a base for design. These create a core idea for concept. The ideas at this stage are realised as a bread-crumb of either a resource or independent idea. These are developed by adding to the idea and creating a higher level design. These designs should be possible to conceptualise - possible to create into small projects for concept.

---
# Prototyping
Prototyping is the ultimate development of these ideas (before realisation in the final product). A small project (or section of a project) takes the idea (or ideas) and produces a product which demonstrates the core concept. 

## Vertical and Horizontal Prototyping
Some prototypes will not contain a single idea but instead a single slice of gameplay. These are the Vertical and Horizontal prototypes. Vertical prototypes demonstrate the full extent of the product but are only small snippets of the product in length / content. A vertical prototype may have well polish gameplay, audio, visuals, user interface and a level but nothing more. A horizontal prototype is instead a more fleshed out version of one of the elements of the product, the user interface experience or the gameplay (but without final visuals or audio).

## Playtest and Review
The key part to prototyping is play testing and review. The advantage of a prototype is that it is fast to produce and fast to adjust developed designs. The reviews should include the states of the games, what works, what does not and then develop the ideas if there is a chance change may work.

## Overall Review
Prototypes are not the final product, once a concept is at the peek of where development will produce results there should be a conclusion or overview review of the prototype. This will feedback into the design stage. A feature design will feed from this prototyping stage and will use this as a data point in their designs.
