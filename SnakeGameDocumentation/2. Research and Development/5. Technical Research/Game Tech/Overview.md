# Summary
The game engine technology requires research before a commitment is made for the technical design and initial design in terms of tech. Although some code will be portable among engines the vast majority of code will not be inter-great-able (able to be integrated easily) and the overhead will be great.

Fated.Quest by default uses Unity Engine but is also yet to release a product so the option is still open and tech from Fated.Quest is not to be used for this project - every is likely to be created new for this project.

# Requirements
There are base requirements for any Game Technology to meet the basics of a product to distribute and develop with.

1. Developable on Windows 10.
2. Distributable on Windows, Mobile and Console.
3. In a language frictionless enough for the developers to use.
4. Built for Test Driven Development and SOLID principles.
5. Must supply or be easily compatible with graphics, sound, input and file handling.

## Develop on Windows
The entire development deployment environment is Microsoft Windows 10. To consider another operating system would assume that another technology and technology suite (as multiple operating systems may not be viable or viable with a reasonable development cycle) is significantly better. For now this is a requirement until there is suitable capital to consider another operating system in-which research to both the operating system *and* game tech would take place.

## Distributable on Windows, Mobile and Console
This project may not distribute on all these platforms however the tech used here will likely become the tech used for Fated.Quest. The products created would best be distributed via many different market places and platforms. This is a requirement and the ease at which this may be done is an advantage.
