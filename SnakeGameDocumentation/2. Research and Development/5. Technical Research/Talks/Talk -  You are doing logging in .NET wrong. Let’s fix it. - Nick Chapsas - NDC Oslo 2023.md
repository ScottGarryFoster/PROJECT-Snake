# Take-Aways
## C# Compiler
* When C# builds there is a step between the CLI and the Complier which interprets the code. This changes from version to version (how and what is translated) and Core is different to the framework versions. 
* This is to protect the compiler from build failures and from mistranslation
* One of the translations is string interpolation:
```c#
string something = $"I am {name} and I am {age} years old";

string becomes = string.Format("I am {0} and I am {1} years old", name, age);
```
* Note In .net version 9 this is not the case.
* The reason this is an issue, is that Format and Concat use arrays (the second half of the above is an object array).
* When casting to an object or hard casting another type (like `return (int)myObject;`) the value will exist on the heap and then need to be cleaned up later by the garbage collector.
* Additionally consider the amount of string in code which are always allocated on the heap slowing down the application.
* String interpolation handlers will not save you in this case but they will help. This is because they will at least reduce the number of strings to a single final string on the heap.

> Key take away, heap fast, stack slow. Strings and boxing always on the heap.
