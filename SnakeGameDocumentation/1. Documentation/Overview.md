All the documentation, planning, guides and notes for the project are found here. The documentation may be viewed online via [Github](https://github.com/ScottGarryFoster/PROJECT-Snake/blob/main/SnakeGameDocumentation) the better method however is to install [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and open this as a Vault see instructions here.

# Summary
Snake project is a game creation project designed to test the documentation, technical and organisational skills for creating a single game. It is designed to be small enough in scope to conclude with a clear end point with the possibility for expansion.

The documentation is split up into the phases of game production. The phases may occur in parallel to one another. All phases contain planning, knowledge bases and templates for ease of use. Other headings may be included which are subject specific.

The goal of documentation is to ensure decisions are made with reason and the reasoning is not lost or forgotten. The documentation contained here is in tandem with the [Github Planning features](https://github.com/features/issues) which for this project are found [here](https://github.com/ScottGarryFoster/PROJECT-Snake/projects?query=is%3Aopen).

# Common Categories
There are a few common categories which are repeated in almost every phase / department of production. This section is included to explain their role.

## Knowledge Base
Explanations of a given workflow, library or tutorial are found in here. Support entries for both internal and external tools may be found here.

## Planning
Design documents, forecasts and general planning documents.

## Templates
Notes which may be copied and have notes where generic information should be replaced for specific information. These should be obvious or marked with a markdown tag 'quote' > such as the below:
>Replace this with something else.

# Common Features
There are some common features of documentation to look out for.

## Document Status
At the top of most pages is a *status box* which contains the owner, state and last time the page was edited. This should be filled out and edited each time there is an edit on the page. Below is an example of the template and below that an example of this filled out.

**The date format must always be: Date Month Year DD(rd/th/st) MMM YYYY**

|Owner|State|Last_update|
|--|--|--|
|USERNAME|Draft, Development, Review, Signed off|Date|

|Owner|State|Last_update|

## Tags at the top
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) allows for searching via Tags. Documentation for this may be found [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags). All pages must be tagged and tags are found at the top of the page.
`#myTag`

## Table of Contents
Most pages will contain a table of contents. This is a [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) set of links to headings in the page. It is created using an extension within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Instructions for how to use / insert these may be found [here](obsidian://open?vault=SnakeGameDocumentation&file=1.%20Documentation%2FKnowledge%20Base%2FObsidian). 

## Best Viewed in Obsidian
Some features are best viewed in Obsidian, in particular PlantUML and social media links will display in more visual ways within the Obsidian editor. This allows one to view this information more freely than via Github online.
