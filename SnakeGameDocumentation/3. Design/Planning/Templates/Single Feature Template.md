# Why

> **Explain why the given feature will work within the game**

## Design Risks

> **Is there anything this design may break or it may close off (or make more difficult to design) in the future? Ensure to add either mitigation or validation!**

## Background Research

> **Other games or books with the mechanics explained within it.**
---

# Considerations

> **What other departments or sections of the game should be considered or might require additional technology to create this feature.**

## Game Rating

> **Does this feature have the ability to raise the rating?**

## Patents, Trademarks and Copyright

> **Does this overlap with existing patents, could this be patented.**

## Build and Systems

> **Is there any big data processing required to get this feature working.**

## Tools

> **Do we require more tools to make this work and allow designers to use this feature.**

## Save file implications

> **Will this affect how the game saves / loads data and what might that be.**

## Performance Implications

> **Will this affect performance in some way? Would we need to increase the target machines to play the game?**

## Effect on other systems

> **Might this affect other systems such as economical, battle or exploration.**
