# Core
>*Describe the game idea in a single sentence, what the player will do, what they will feel and why it exists.*

>*Describe in short the core gameplay loop, what will the player do over and over again - why will they keep coming back for more.*

>*Why should this game exists? Who is it appealing to? Why should it be created? What is at the core of it's creation?*

---
# Pillars
>*Set out the main pillars for the design for the game. Ideally no more than 5. A good number is 3.*

>*An example of a Pillar would be Exploration, Domination, Community, Collection, Captivity.*

>*Pillars are built upon additional terms and descriptions to describe further features for the game.*

---
# Features
>*Describe some main features. You do not need to go into great detail, this document is not for the nitty gritty but is for the broad strokes. Link from here to your Feature documents.*

>*A feature / mechanic could be a movement system, inventory, driving, exploration, story etc. If it is not listed here then it does not mean it is not in the game, these are the 'main' features.*

---

# Audience
>*Describe the target audience for the title.*

>*Back up who this audience is and related them not just to the title (and genre) but to how this game in particular relates to them.*

---
# Interface
>*Describe how information is portrayed to the player, how do they under your features?*

>*This does not need to just be visual but may also be audio based.*

---
# Controls
>*Describe how the player will control the game and more so why this is an appropriate control scheme for the game.*

>*Try to include accessibility somewhat in this however you may as with everything link to another page for this.*

---
# Story
>*Describe the broad strokes of the story if any. This is not what the story is, storylines etc but what you might find on the back of a book.*

>*Non-cutscene based interactions and context based story is outlined in the broadest strokes here.*

---
# Visual Style
>*How will the game look. Include screenshots and images. This should be backed up and relate to an audience and genre.*

>*Visual style should also relate to the gameplay, is there a reason it is 2D/3D or a reason it uses an art style?*

---
# Music & Sound
>*What types of music and sound are to be used. Every song and sound effect does not need to be included, but some idea of these should be (link off to other locations for this info).*

>*How sound relates to visuals, controls and accessibility is also important.*

---
# Marketing
>*Marketing begins now, what potential is there for marketing within the gameplay. Is there the potential for sharing and spreading the game concepts before release?*

>*What is the plan marketing wise, could we begin dev blogs, articles etc? If we are contacting influencers who and why?*

---
# Platform
>*Describe the platforms which would be best suited for this title.*

>*Back up your choices with evidence for the target audience and genre.*

---
# Monetization
>*How is the product funded and monetized? Platform matters here, paid up front does not work as well on Android as on iOS, Free to Play must not be best on console etc.*

>*Audience plays a big role, younger audiences may not have the money up front. Free to play, is free to try. Older audiences more likely to pay for a single experience with DLC.*

>*Marketing, platform and monetization are highly related. All must come together and work with the core demographic for a successful product.*

---
# Localization
>*Where is this to be sold and what markets are we targeting?*

>*What concerns may the design hold for the different markets?*
